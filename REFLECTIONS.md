# Reflection

1. Before analyzing the data, I predicted that more sleep would correlate with higher focus levels, that higher screen time would relate to lower mood, and that increased caffeine intake would improve focus. After running the program, some of these assumptions were challenged. While Wednesday had the highest screen time, it also showed high focus, which contradicted my expectation that screen time would negatively affect performance.

2. One surprising result was that caffeine did not show a clear positive relationship with focus. Even though I expected higher caffeine intake to increase focus, the output suggested there was no strong correlation. This helped me realize that habits I assume are helpful may not actually have the effect I may subconsciously or consciously expect when looked at across multiple days.

3. The most challenging part of this assignment was translating abstract ideas like “correlation” into simple JavaScript logic using arrays and loops. At the same time, this was the most rewarding aspect because it demonstrated how basic Chapter 4 concepts such as objects, arrays, and iteration, can still reveal meaningful patterns. Using my own data made the analysis more engaging and helped me better understand why structured data matters.
